Vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying weakness in a system by using different types of tools and techniques.
Here, Now we are going to use the tools and techiques. For Example Port Scanning,Vulnerability Scanning and Web Application Security Testing Etc.
Here We are usinng www.westernunion.com as a target now firstly we'll scan its port by using Nmap
We Have Two Ways now first one is directly scan the domain and second one is Firstly we Find out domain's Ip And scann It.
Domain Scan Is slower Because When We directly scan domain nmap firstly find its ip and than works on ip scan and in second it directly works on ip's ports.
We Have Several Methods to get ip of any domain For Example :- dig www.example.com , nslookup www.example.com , host www.example.com, ping www.example.com etc.
So, Here we Go..........
After Executing Command( nmap -p 21,22,23,25,53,80,110,143,443,445,3306,3389 66.218.161.27 OR nmap -sV -p 21,22,23,25,53,80,110,143,443,445,3306,3389 66.218.161.27
) . (-sV Stand For Service and version Detetction)
-sV Flag Helps to get inform about the services running on ports with their versions (its not mandatory for extra information we can use this command)
OUr Result after the command is :- 
PORT    STATE        SERVICE        
21/tcp  open          FTP (File Transfer Protocol)       
22/tcp  filtered      SSH
23/tcp  filtered    telnet
25/tcp  filtered      smtp
53/tcp  filtered    domain
80/tcp  open          http
110/tcp filtered      pop3
143/tcp filtered      imap
443/tcp open         https
445/tcp filtered    microsoft-ds
3306/tcp filtered   mysql
3389/tcp filtered   ms-wbt-server
SO Let me explain You About Evry Port One By One:-
1. Port 21/tcp (FTP) State: Open:- An open FTP port means the server is accepting connections and can be accessed for file uploads and downloads.(Attacks Like Bruteforce Etc. Possible)
2. Port 22/tcp (SSH) - Filtered :- It provides a secure channel for logging into remote systems and executing commands.(If port 22 were open, attackers might attempt to guess SSH credentials.)
3. Port 23/tcp (Telnet) - Filtered:- The "filtered" state here suggests that a firewall or security device is blocking access to this port.It's used for text-based communication with remote systems.
4. Port 25/tcp (SMTP) - Filtered:- it Is Used For sending email messages.(If it misconfigured,SMTP server could be used to send spam or malicious emails known as open relay attack.)
5. Port 53/tcp (DNS) - Filtered:-DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. Filtering indicates that it is not directly accessible.(If This Port Was Open And accessible DNS Spoofing Attack Possibles.)
6. Port 80/tcp (HTTP) - Open:-HTTP protocol IS Used For Transferring Webpages. ( commonly targeted for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or XSS.)
7. Port 110/tcp (POP3) - Filtered:-POP3 protocol is used for retrieving email from a server. (Filtering suggests itâ€™s not directly accessible.)
8. Port 143/tcp (IMAP) - Filtered:-IMAP allows access to email on a remote server.(Filtering indicates restricted access.)
9. Port 443/tcp (HTTPS) - Open:-HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between the client and server.(If HTTPS NOt configured properly than MITM attack is Possible.)
10.Port 445/tcp (SMB) - Filtered:-SMB used for file sharing and network communication (if it were accessible than Attack like Ransomware are Possible.)
11.Port 3306/tcp (MySQL) - Filtered:-MySQL is used for database management. Filtering suggests it is not directly accessible.(If Accessible SQL injection and database exploits Possible.)
12.Port 3389/tcp (RDP) - Filtered:-RDP is used for remote desktop access. Filtering indicates restricted access.

                                                                    {{{{{Conclusion}}}}}
1.Open Ports (21, 80, 443): These ports are accessible and could be targeted for various attacks such as credential guessing, web vulnerabilities, and SSL/TLS exploits.
2.Filtered Ports (22, 23, 25, 53, 110, 143, 445, 3306, 3389): These ports are protected or blocked, reducing direct exposure to attacks. 
However, if misconfigured or if firewall rules are not properly managed, there could still be risks.
Ensuring the above Services are properly configured and use of strong authentication mechanisms and regular security assessments can help to protect websites from potential threats.
